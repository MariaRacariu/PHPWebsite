        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Well I would like to become a CSGO professional player but sadly not there yet. I like playing a bunch of games
            like Genshin Impact, OSU! and many more. I also like watching movie and series. My brain is pretty creative so
            I always end up doing something that has to do with art or is connected to it. I have studied at NTI high school
            here in Malmö and after that I took a break to figure out what I wanted to do in the future. I decided after
            taking a look at my grades that I should probably study Web developing because that was the only course I got
            an A at. So then I applied for a bunch of UNIs and got into this one. I accepted because it looked interesting
            and I knew that I would be working alongside smart adults who also are passionate about web. </p>
        <p>
            I will probably find work after this school because I can't see myself studying anymore. Maybe after a few years of working
            I might go to another University to get a higher education but that is in the future. I would like to work at
            a big company where you get to work in groups because if I worked alone I would not get anything done.
