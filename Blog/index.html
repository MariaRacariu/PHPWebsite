                <p>Everyone is depressed and if you are not then you are the odd one out. Teenagers are more depressed then
                    asylum patient in the 1970s. Does this prove that all our parents where sick in the head or is this a
                    side affect of them being born directly after WW2 to parents who mostly likely served or where
                    affected by it.

                    Cats have been evolving to be the humans best friend witch does not really wanna hang out all the time but does this prove
                    that cats will take over the world at some point. The cats have been communication with humans for thousands
                    of years and might even be some type of gods.

                <p class="date">2021-09-31</p>
                <p>
                    It seams that the old generations can not adapt to the new technology. Is this a sign that we are too evolved or do humans
                    lose brain cells as they get older? The ability to learn how to use a computer of how a router works
                    is the most common knowledge but old people do not seam to get it. Does this prove that the school system
                    failed them and does that mean that the school system will fail the future generations.
